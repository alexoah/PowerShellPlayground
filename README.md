# Alexoah's PowerShell Playground
A playground on PowerShell scripts.  
I'm using it on Windows 7, not sure if they'll work on yours.

This repository's update will be super slow, because I have rarely used PowerShell these days.  
Thank you for your visit!

## List of Exercises
* [PS_BSPlayground](./PS_BSPlayground):  
They are PowerShell scripts (and related files) I coded back then to create template files and folders for my answers to [W3School's BOOTSTRAP 3 Exercises](https://github.com/alexoah/BSPlayground/W3School-BS3Exercises).
