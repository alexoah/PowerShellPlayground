# Alexoah's PowerShell Playground
A playground on PowerShell scripts.  
I used them on Windows 7 (not even my computer), not sure if they'll work on your system.

I have rarely used PowerShell these days, but it's really fun to use PowerShell. :)  
Thank you for your visit!

## List of "Exercises"
* [PowerShell Script for Repositories' "W3School" Template](./PS1_RepoW3S):  
They are PowerShell script (and related files) I coded back then to create template files and folders for my answers to W3School's exercises in my other "Playground" repositories.
