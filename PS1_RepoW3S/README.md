# Alexoah's PowerShell Script for Repositories' "W3School" Template
If you happened to visit my other "Playground" repositories with my answers to W3School's exercises, you might notice that those answer files had some "patterns".  
This is one example on how I did the templates.  
Below is the whole package I did to create my template files and folders for [W3School's BOOTSTRAP 3 Exercises](https://github.com/alexoah/BSPlayground/tree/master/W3School-BS3Exercises) back then:

* [BSPlayground-W3School.bat](./PS1_BSPlayground-W3School/BSPlayground-W3School.bat)  
A little "tool" I did to help me overcome my laziness in opening new window.  
So here, I would only need to double click this .bat file to run the BSPlayground-W3School.ps1 script.  

* [BSPlayground-W3School.ps1](./PS1_BSPlayground-W3School/BSPlayground-W3School.ps1)  
This is *the* PowerShell script.  
This is where I coded the script to create the whole template files and folders for my answers to W3School's exercises.  

* [BSPlayground-W3School.csv](./PS1_BSPlayground-W3School/BSPlayground-W3School.csv)  
This .csv file is where I put the entries of "Exercise Name, Question URL, Tutorial URL, Number of Questions" for the header in my answer files.  
This file uses Comma (,) for list separator. If your computer locale setting uses Comma (,) for list separator, you won't need BSPlayground-W3School-semicolon.csv to replace this file.  

* [BSPlayground-W3School-semicolon.csv](./PS1_BSPlayground-W3School/BSPlayground-W3School-semicolon.csv)  
This is the original .csv file I was using back then, because the computer's locale system used Semicolon (;) for list separator. I decided to also upload it here.  
So, if your computer also uses Semicolon (;) for list separator, just remove the previous BSPlayground-W3School.csv file, and rename this one (BSPlayground-W3School-semicolon.csv) to BSPlayground-W3School.csv as the replacement.

* [BSPlayground-W3School.txt](./PS1_BSPlayground-W3School/BSPlayground-W3School.txt)  
This .txt is the main template for my answer files.

NB:  
I used them on Windows 7, not sure if they'll work on your system.  
This computer isn't mine, there's no proper compiler etc. being installed here, so I coded most of things (and also my other repositories, including this README file) using Notepad++.  Please let me know if there's any bug or any suggestion for code optimization.  
Thank you for your visit and feedback. :)
